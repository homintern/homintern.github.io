<p>so i loved the sermon so i<br />
discovered shadows in one of these doorways<br />
a cold blooded killing overwrites any cracks<br />
impeccable ethics hot wax and a quiet song<br />
mounds of hewn beef shudder under the singing of birds<br />
the crescendo akin to a safe raw clots the presumption of faithlessness<br />
the singing viscous just like in that square where we parted with mark<br />
marcus and matvei he fished a hand in my pocket<br />
but couldn’t find anything telling<br />
the face of lucretia in the outpour of lymph atop marble<br />
due to his sorrow I kissed him on the temple in parting<br />
he grew sadder still<br />

<p>When you loved each fine edge<br />
call the tip of his name call it later<br />
as the dark moon’s stalks rise above names<br />
and on this day if we held vigil with the past<br />
who would we call<br />
golden capillaries while they offer you frames of white gold<br />
i will tell you how each full moon my<br />
mother brought scissors<br />
to the inside of my elbow<br />
(expensive rings? Patriarchal betrayals? nuclear adhesions of doubt?)<br />
she cut skin but as if it wasn’t serious<br />
as if it wasn’t mine<br />
every time as if slitting my father’s throat<br />
on this day so that we might remember<br />
warm winds of luxury warm winds of pain<br />
sweet twist of yearning the dark bends of home<br />
afterwards as one beats the other as the other beats the first<br />
i look at summer’s contusions, at August’s, at winter’s<br />
undifferentiated in their flowing breadth<br />
now father beats mother and vice versa<br />
i look in the crevice of dusk of their intent<br />
why would you tell the wayside plantago mother and stepmother the road there and back<br />
you return<br />
their names are victor valentin georgy herman gennady herman<br />
anna olga oleg vyacheslav nastya and once again nastya katya katya galya grisha<br />
denis daria then denis and derya demian slava lesha kostya<br />
further on<br />
how would i find it in me to say it again? this isn’t the knot of linear monogamy<br />
but of message<br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>dark hail of moonlight apartment stone intoxication grabs you by the hand<br />
my mother’s hands are scissors at my own<br />
precious stones and gadflies that lay eggs under the skin<br />
morning phone calls family funerals oncologists and dim corridors<br />
excised of meaning oleg darius georgy gennady<br />
no longer are there spirals of autoreplies under shortparis<sup>1</sup> insta stories<br />
have i told you yet? no? where drowns in the languid gold of your past<br />
all too loud all too good to be true, even, for the past<br />
valentin georgy herman gennady just stop<br />
burdened hands fingers bends of misfortune<br />
choose the only novelty left - to not tell- it - afresh - all the details -<br />
oncologists to the past -asphyxiation- a new turn in the river - death or sex is inevitable<br />
