staples<br />
hundreds<br />
millions<br />
of staples make up my shining lizard body<br />
that’s me<br />
after much after i am the other i am the unhinged writer<br />
of these not-words bound for the shitter<br />
where does the lead urine of a blowup doll go?<br />
let’s inquire with the stones re: the genocides caused with their bodies<br />
let’s ask saint google about all this<br />
saint google tell me how much truth remains to us<br />
saint google tell me who manuel gabriel tzoc bucup really is<br />
saint google what do these words mean war-peace-humanity<br />
saint google i affirm to you that memory and love exist<br />
syphilization came on us<br />
literally, rows of staples spread out on the white floor<br />
with all that, heart violated<br />
don’t look at me<br />
it’s more interesting outside<br />
breathe the dust of the angry volcanoes<br />
drink the hot blood of the wounded volcanoes<br />
in the polar dream my nephews built me a castle of staples<br />
dozens hundreds millions of staples<br />
just images i only believe in images<br />
for example that i’m a pony disguised as a horse (or vice versa)<br />
making my way through the city silence<br />
shadow on the word shadow<br />
shadow on the word beer can<br />
shadows on the hands that click and write about time<br />
opening and closing popups on an infected computer<br />
typing typing<br />
manuel typing uselessly on time<br />
<br />

i need to investigate brakeless cars throughout the city so as to get into an accident i’m looking for those violent beautiful crashes and beautiful absurd deaths full of glam glitch and gloss: i’ll die squashed by an enormous billboard advertising plastic surgeries in the middle of the desert or via french fry jammed in my throat I’m at the best point of my life but a caterpillar is eating my brain and the rest of me is carried off by an army of red and murderous ants to the morgue of destiny we steal abandoned bodies we’re kleptos we steal love we steal raspberry pies we abduct the emotions of the weak-hearted<br />
<br />
ping pong with my summertime brains<br />
ping pong with my bull testicles<br />
ping pong with my cow tits that give black milk<br />
ping pong with the eyes they took when they tortured me for being a poet and providing publicity service in my works: language therapy amorous liaisons sexual vengeance success in shady business deals word recycling sale of spare hearts, new and used<br />
<br />
where you coming from young man, indigenous and a poet<br />
the little green men asked of me<br />
what are you planning<br />
what are you plotting glam poetry youth<br />
<br />
but i lied to the little green men i told the whole truth to my right hand she’s the only one who knows the secrets i’m planning i’m going to bury the city in an avalanche of WILD STRAWBERRIES* under a mountain of stuffed pandas i’ll drown the townspeople in blowup dolls with huge tits and big dicks flee the memories that date back to a writer’s preoccupation with the breadcrumbs sprinkled on the table and with the coffee a ninja turtle a pink elephant and an atomic ant are swimming in we defy language or language defying us we fell into disgrace and it was YOUR FAULT and the word’s<br />

the pen wars began above the beaten nations the homocyborgs write of the memory of the disappeared bodies a pig with a poetry mask came to scare me to wake me up he said : let’s go!!! get up gayboy the crayon war is coming down on us<br />

we’ll kill ourselves surfing the october waves of an unfinished fractured guatemala, of the eternal compost heap<br />
<br />
we’ll set out with a criminal suitcase full of empty books and personal articles: shampoo, bathroom soap, towel, body lotion, hair gel, deodorant, shaving cream, razors, toothbrush and paste, mouthwash, brushes, mirrors, toilet paper and a cheap perfume, part from this some photochromic lenses, a remote control, an apple brand laptop, laptop, 36 gb usb drives, pepsi-cola canned sodas, a latest-model stereo with rechargeable batteries, led-light lanterns, a stuffed bear that tells you “i love you” when you press its belly, surfboards, toy yachts, plastic flowers, plastic chairs, plastic tables, plastic everything, plastic thoughts, tricolor trikinis, binoculars, magnifying glasses, sunglasses of course, a tent, GPS bracelets connected to other[^1] people’s hearts, come on gayboy what are you missing… sunscreen for UV rays, a huge touchscreen phone, unlimited data and calling and a 25000 megapixel camera antennas lots of antennas and a golden bathroom where i can see myself shit and some raging winds shut up in a liquor bottle to celebrate the failure of being a modern artist in this wasted, battered territory, we’ll keep at it anyway, of course gayboy, we’ll keep at it<br />
writing<br />
drawing<br />
filming<br />
dreaming dim ideas of a country of postal code<br />
-502-<br />

i didn’t wake up<br />
i remained in the night of malignant states<br />
because an intellectual and lyric someone<br />
spoke to me between the 1,000 oneiric windows of dawn<br />
<br />
one time in the stadium of 1,000 car seats the brainy kids<br />
[booed<br />
<br />
my poetic style… what poetic style<br />
<br />
¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿¿???????????????????????????????????????????????????<br />
<br />
BOOOOO!!!!! BOOOOOO!!!<br />
<br />
my poetic style is my hairy hand of 666 fingers writing this quicker than a fucking cutting edge computer i’ll never give up my little notebook or my finepoint pencils i’ll fill thousands of empty notebooks that’ll hold the rotting aromas disabled words will contain and corrosive pollen particles that will fix themselves on your eyes I FEEL that it’s abusive that ideas should wake me so from sleep if my brain were at least always connected to a next gen machine to register my celestial visions i wouldn’t have to get up to write them with my monkey hand of 666 electronic fingers<br />
<br />
neither would i have to shoot all the movies filmed in my dreams only i will know the stories and I’LL BE EGOTISTICAL WITH THE WORLD<br />

poetic disturbances sound in my head:<br />
<br />
ruckus… the knife-sharpener’s sirens<br />
won’t leave me alone<br />
the portrait of my parents scares me<br />
<br />
the blue pigs land on my left shoulder / dressed as plated flies / the thing is, one day we’ll be there / far away / on that ferocious and distant star / within the reach of the failed eyes and the broken hearts / hugging and kissing the blue pigs and plated flies / there’ll be time to rest in a blender and fragment love / or better still to cut the eye of the pubescent porcelain doll with the 20cm knife i keep in my dolce &amp; gabbana purse / next to the EVA brand pad<br />
<br />
my fault<br />
my fault<br />
by the great fault of andy warhol’s banana peel<br />
i fell into scandals<br />
but: the most refined ones<br />

what the drugs will do with so much night<br />
<br />
Dream 0: smash a tender brain full of great ideas with a golden hammer<br />
<br />
Dream 1: M’s sky is upholstered with wax paper, broken mirrors, and pornographic stickers<br />
<br />
Dream 2: face of a crossdressing boy showing me a field of damp and dilated dildos<br />
<br />
Dream 3: i’ve fantasized crossing the street at top speed against a red light in a grey van full of friends and being hit at rush hour at nighttime hours where there are no witnesses to help us and pay for the freakshow<br />
<br />
Dream 4: i eat drink and fornicate at a crazy mennonite party, the farm links up with the sexual banquet all night long<br />

every single artist died yesterday, every one…<br />
<br />
how is it possible that he LOVE the text and hate the writer or it might be BACKWARDS<br />
<br />
not sure<br />
<br />
but i think that lots of my friends are herons smoking weed or labeled plastic ponies running happily through vast white fields, no, better i think of them modeling haute couture latex suits in an ANomaloUS fashion show<br />
<br />
the final campbell’s soups for me and my artists friends are expired conquered by time sold rotten to a gallery where we go to exhibit and fuck calmly<br />
<br />
ahh!!! what will have become of TRUTH… without my friends the pelican poets blowing their brains out with an ultra-sharpened mirror knife and all for what… to add one word more to their WISH to sleep —at least— this one outraged night<br />

they ask if i write, no, i drool emotion over graph paper notebooks<br />
they ask again if i write, no, i jab my body with syringes to get the good blood to the poetry<br />
they insist in asking my if i write, i told you no, i take my heart out i cook it with spices and toast the other diners with it<br />
they persist in asking me if i write, i said it already stop fucking around, i masturbate each word to get the bad nut out for the metaphors<br />
