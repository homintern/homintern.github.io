<p>we fucked as if we were fucking for everyone<br />
fucked up in the black membranes of blinding night<br />
esse est percipi, having forgotten and killed in every aperture<br />
sliding wormholes<br />
re-inhabiting myself re-melting everyone else<br />
every night I was collecting myself in this fucking<br />
I was gathering myself in this long big love<br />
and having gathered myself so that blood festered in my cunt<br />
turned into a moat<br />
turned almost seamlessly<br />
all broken pieces regenerated<br />
how near stitchlessly your body reassembled<br />
every night as I looked for your pieces<br />
I thought<br />
about the men who smashed you to bits<br />
about the bastards who ate your pieces<br />
about your brazen bones<br />
within gnawed rotting meat<br />
about this pitch black love of mine<br />
forgetting ontological divisions<br />
forgetting borders in entwined contours<br />
the contours did not hurt<br />
we entered a new invincible world<br />
and fucked so that time would freeze up<br />
it was becoming a matrix<br />
the pink vagina<br />
of a new utopia<br />
it collected the whole world and inverted it<br />
just so that after three years<br />
you could leave me for a right-wing propagandist<br />
I already see how she spins the rallies<br />
I go to giving me<br />
the Judas Kiss<br />
reads Dugin and then licks you out<br />
with tongues of violent militarism licks you<br />
after the award ceremony on the fucking red square<br />
I know more about her than you do for we had<br />
a tender friendship<br />
a tender tender friendship<br />
esse est percipi tender tender friendship<br />
cunt is an organ of knowledge tender friendship<br />
lesbian jihad or tender tender friendship<br />
lesbian jihad begins with a faithful bitch<br />
lesbian jihad or the debate between Spinoza and Hobbes<br />
lesbian jihad or the half of a Labrys<br />
lesbian jihad<br />
carthago delenda est<br />
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>she will fuck you<br />
            knowing all my texts<br />
about your cunt and her bitter wetness<br />
she will fuck you like shit darling<br />
            since a good fuck<br />
is a matter of politics<br />
and that’s why<br />
our fucking back then<br />
            was so good<br />
