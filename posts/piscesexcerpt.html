<h2>The Pisces</h2>
<section id="for-elaine-kahn" class="level3">
<h3>For Elaine Kahn</h3>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I leave my friends behind, at their houses and at their bars.</p>
<p>An astrological tweet that morning predicted:</p>
<p>Pisces – An act of courage tonight will bring</p>
<p>months of emotional excitement</p>
<p>for which you are not prepared.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I walked down the block and to the left</p>
<p>with the cordial self-assuredness</p>
<p>of those who never had any troubles</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>under this moon rain drops blister like neons</p>
<p>stepping down town in this tiny metropolis</p>
<p>drunken with literature where stories</p>
<p>begin among other stories without ever ending</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and when a stranger asks your name:</p>
<p>match their bluff, respond in tone, keep the mood going,</p>
<p>it’s an exercise in style, in imitating gestures and voices</p>
<p>be a pastiche of their fantasies, a satire of their cosmology,</p>
<p>Keep this up at least until the nakedness of a third date</p>
<p>If you are talking to a firebrand</p>
<p>tell them you are a firebrand yourself,</p>
<p>and that’s why your royal family sent you abroad,</p>
<p>and that’s why you look like a Corsican shepherd.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When Helen asked where Paris had been hiding until then</p>
<p>They said: when my sister and I were born my mother dreamt</p>
<p>they were birthing a firebrand that would burn the city they sired</p>
<p>and that is why my family sent me away</p>
<p>and that is why I’ve always been hiding</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Helen said: don’t you dare hide and come out,</p>
<p>the riches promised you by birthright</p>
<p>they might always be just one more veil away.</p>
<p>Remember what a waste every unseen nakedness is.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>See: I have taken so many forms in the fields</p>
<p>I can’t carry them unless you help me make a garland</p>
<p>the crown will go to the one who races the fastest</p>
<p>take my hand and let’s knot our hair together</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What is up with your strange tiny hands?</p>
<p>they are smaller than mine, can you even hold a cup</p>
<p>buy me a drink and moisten my lips and I will</p>
<p>kiss that hand, if you will kiss mine then too</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whenever Helen needs effervescent refreshment,</p>
<p>they tell the expert brewer:</p>
<p>“Brew me the best beer ever brewed.”</p>
<p>I wish I had come up with that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They ask of the sacred band of Thebes</p>
<p>the golden army of 150 pairs of gay lovers</p>
<p>have you ever heard of something so hot and horny</p>
<p>like a fantasy gay antifa, or a communist gay gun club</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Could you even imagine an army of lovers</p>
<p>to let a thousand flowers bloom</p>
<p>blinding like the solar golden record</p>
<p>their sacred band, their shining shields</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>the harvest is soon upon us</p>
<p>summer is a lightning bolt</p>
<p>Mao knew it well, they are</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>all armed and chanting in unison</p>
<p>this is the time of our revenge</p>
<p>this is the time of our revenge</p>
<p>Could you even imagine an army of lovers</p>
<p>with the one who always hid their face</p>
<p>as their shoulders shook with laughter</p>
<p>always holding it in their hands</p>
<p>perhaps scared it would fall off</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The one who froze all mousy and terrified</p>
<p>to always be the prey and never praying</p>
<p>the one for whom emetophobia was self care</p>
<p>for deep and drawn-out sadness feels like nausea</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The one whose body aches and spasms</p>
<p>so violently they throw themselves aground</p>
<p>to cry and moan and fill their mouth</p>
<p>with sawdust and cloth and mites</p>
<p>to clog a thirsting throat, to hold their breath</p>
<p>until their diaphragm rebels and coughs and coughs</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Have you noticed that dog, the reactionary white guard</p>
<p>chanting in secret, between the I swear, I swear</p>
<p>one more time, one more chance</p>
<p>this is the time we are going to change</p>
<p>this is the time we are going to change</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And, if the kingdom is of the meek, they can take a city</p>
<p>have you looked up at the sky yet, still copper-lit</p>
<p>from the lingering flames of the oldest earthly city</p>
<p>filled with regret, their heart bestially aching in the world</p>
<p>The old turning their face, leaning against the walls in ruin</p>
<p>as a busboy cleans the empty tables and the empty chairs</p>
<p>spilled with the overturned cups of tomorrow’s laughter</p>
<p><br />

I’ve noticed that a quarter past eleven is the only time at which a day ever truly starts<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To say on a Monday morning that you have secured the bag, criminal activity must be involved<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only after committing my first felony in the United States, I got the courage to wear jewelry<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn’t my very first, at 13 I stole a motorbike and took it apart in an uncomfortable garage<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The absence of judgment and time’s forgetfulness absolve my conscience always already silent<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can’t become US citizens: drug users, sex workers, communists, and anyone of moral turpitude<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You sad cops and weepy bureaucrats just couldn’t have stayed in your father’s womb<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At Larry Flynt’s a girl waits for her boyfriend to leave and ask me: are you here for work or fun?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dance, save money, hire a boudoir photographer, and when you can get ads, ads are important<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At Dixie Divas theyed enter with dogs, and read aloud the girl’s names as they identified them<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Asked what I do for a living, this time I say: I bring together very rich people and entertainers<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like for Coachella? No, you could say more like for Coachella adjacent events<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Strung along a cute DEA investigator, talking of my dark secret as if I were a comic book hero<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What would you have done commissioner, if you ever found out who my friends were<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Married to the carceral you would have knocked on our doors with your bejeweled fist<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Elsewhere after Branko, S*** says I never liked Xanax until I started to fear they’ll take my wife<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A man screams in the street as a crowd gathers around him, come we’ll send you home<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And Baal, dark and so lovely, a beast at the heart of the world cries back Where?<br />
