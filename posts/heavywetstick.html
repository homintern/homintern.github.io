<p>I am lying in the dark<br />
can’t fall asleep<br />
remembering the sentence of the blind man, last name Beloglazov<br />
he battered his wife and shoved a rolling pin into her vagina<br />
there was so much blood<br />
she died<br />
but he wasn’t put in jail<br />
because the medical examiner said that<br />
the wife hit her head against the corner of the house<br />
several hours prior<br />
and that this trauma was the cause of death<br />
the judge said the son said the mother said<br />
she had a headache<br />
and the judge said<br />
this proves that she hit her head against the corner of the house<br />
and would have died anyway<br />
even if Beloglazov hadn’t shoved a rolling pin into her vagina<br />
so they released Beloglazov<br />
he wasn’t even given a suspended sentence<br />
just a 3000 ruble fine<br />
for shoving a rolling pin<br />
for the wife screaming in pain<br />
for there being so much blood<br />
and she was dying<br />
bloody<br />
in pain<br />
alone<br />
on the floor<br />
she lay on the floor in a pool of blood<br />
she screamed<br />
her mother told the court<br />
there was so much blood<br />
everyone was amazed at how much blood<br />
screams<br />
pain<br />
in Russia rape is when a<br />
cock<br />
is shoved into a<br />
cunt<br />
and thrusts are performed<br />
one thrust is sufficient<br />
and this will be rape<br />
but if they’ve shoved into your<br />
cunt<br />
a rolling pin a stick<br />
any object except for a<br />
cock<br />
and even if many many thrusts are performed<br />
with this rolling pin<br />
any other object except for a<br />
cock<br />
if many thrusts are performed<br />
caused a lot of<br />
pain<br />
if into your<br />
cunt<br />
they have introduced not a<br />
cock<br />
hurting violently<br />
this is not rape<br />
no<br />
no no no<br />
this is not rape<br />
our lovely women<br />
our magnificent women<br />
our womanly women<br />
how would we live without you<br />
dear women<br />
we celebrate you dearly<br />
you decorate our lives<br />
we congratulate you our beloved women<br />
this is not rape no no no<br />

On this spring day we wish You smiles, a wonderful festive mood, happiness in your family, well-being, health for You and Your loved ones! May you always remain alluring, feminine and loved!

in Russia<br />
if a woman has been raped with a rolling pin<br />
it means she was not raped<br />
rape is only possible with a male genital organ<br />
only a male genital organ<br />
has the right to rape<br />
only a cock has the right to rape<br />

DD.MM.YYYY in the time between 18 and 19 o’clock<br />
defendant Beloglazov V.A.<br />
and his wife B.E.<br />
were in their apartment<br />
at this time<br />
and in this location<br />
Beloglazov V.A.<br />
deliberately inflicted upon B.E.<br />
with sufficient force<br />
no fewer than 5 punches<br />
to the area of the face, head and left shoulder.<br />
Beloglazov V.A. took a wooden stick (a rolling pin),<br />
located in the apartment,<br />
after which<br />
slipped off the undergarments of B.E.<br />
and forcefully<br />
inserted<br />

did not foresee<br />
the possibility of generally harmful consequences<br />

Damage to the<br />
vagina<br />
of the victim<br />

and did not extend to the cavity<br />
or the tissue of the pelvis<br />
and therefore<br />
cannot be regarded<br />
as damage<br />
causing grievous bodily harm<br />
The inconsequential size of the<br />
wounds<br />
of the vaginal mucosa (1.5 x 0.3 cm)<br />
permit the aforementioned damage to be considered<br />
as causing<br />
minor harm to the wellbeing<br />
because<br />
in the living<br />
this would have resulted in<br />
short-term disordered health<br />
Wounds (2)<br />
of the mucous membrane of the back wall of the<br />
vagina.<br />
may have occurred due to the effects of a blunt solid object,<br />
not to be immediately dismissed,<br />
as a result of the insertion<br />
into the vagina<br />
of a rolling pin,<br />
and shortly before death<br />
(no more than 1 hour before death)<br />
in the living<br />
would have resulted in<br />
short-term disordered health.<br />
two ruptures of the vaginal wall –<br />
may have occurred as a result of the<br />
insertion<br />
of a blunt object<br />
into the vagina<br />
The aforementioned damage<br />
may have been formed<br />
as a result of the<br />
insertion<br />
into the vagina<br />
of a blunt object<br />
as evidenced by their uneven edges.<br />

surface<br />
the absence of signs of mucosal healing<br />
in the living<br />
would have resulted in<br />
short-term disordered health<br />
indicating<br />
that the aforementioned damage<br />
occurred shortly before<br />
death.<br />
The aforementioned damage<br />
may all have occurred simultaneously,<br />
and therefore are not categorized separately in their degree of severity in harm<br />
to wellbeing. The aforementioned damage<br />
considered hazardous to health<br />
qualifies<br />
as causing<br />
grievous bodily harm<br />

<br />
subsequently he mitigated the severity of the sentence, suggesting to classify the actions of the defendant under Part 4 Article 111 of the criminal code<br />
<br />
grossly negligent behavior resulting in the unintentional death of G.<br />
<br />
The court accepts the indicated change of charge<br />

dragged her from the automobile,<br />
began<br />
to threaten<br />
rape,<br />
grabbed her by the hair,<br />
tried to hit her head against his knee,<br />
inflicted several blows, –<br />
FULL_NAME6 stumbled<br />
and fell on the asphalt.<br />
In this moment<br />
she had already escaped<br />
from FULL_NAME6,<br />
when he began to stand up,<br />
she began to move away<br />
from him<br />
on the left side of the bridge<br />
in the direction of the village ,<br />
heard,<br />
that he stumbled<br />
and fell,<br />
stood,<br />
once more approached her,<br />
vocalizing threats.<br />
<br />
On the side of the road<br />
she saw<br />
<br />
a wooden<br />
<br />
stick<br />
<br />
approximately<br />
<br />
a meter<br />
<br />
long,<br />
<br />
diameter<br />
<br />
7-8 cm,<br />
<br />
narrowed at one end,<br />
<br />
the stick<br />
<br />
was<br />
<br />
wet<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
heavy,<br />
<br />
took<br />
<br />
this<br />
<br />
stick<br />
<br />
with both hands,<br />
<br />
because she would not have been able to hold it with one hand<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
hit<br />
<br />
with this<br />
<br />
stick<br />
<br />
the area<br />
around the left<br />
ear.<br />
<br />
FULL_NAME6 grabbed at the area,<br />
where<br />
she had<br />
<br />
hit him<br />
<br />
and kneeled,<br />
when he removed his hand,<br />
<br />
she<br />
<br />
inflicted<br />
<br />
one<br />
<br />
blow<br />
<br />
with the<br />
<br />
stick<br />
<br />
to the same site<br />
<br />
on his head.<br />
<br />
FULL_NAME6 bent his head<br />
and grabbed with his hand<br />
the left side of his head,<br />
he continued to threaten her,<br />
she became frightened and<br />
<br />
inflicted<br />
<br />
a hit<br />
<br />
on<br />
<br />
the head<br />
<br />
on the right side,<br />
three or four times<br />
<br />
hit<br />
<br />
with a stick<br />
<br />
with<br />
<br />
greater<br />
<br />
force<br />
<br />
than the previous two hits,<br />
<br />
as she remembers it,<br />
<br />
hit<br />
<br />
him<br />
<br />
with<br />
<br />
all<br />
<br />
the<br />
<br />
strength<br />
<br />
she<br />
<br />
had.<br />
<br />
After this FULL_NAME6 began to get up from the ground,<br />
holding onto the railing of the bridge,<br />
he continued to threaten her,<br />
she walked away from him approximately 2 steps,<br />
FULL_NAME6 held the railing of the bridge with his left hand,<br />
and the right one hung down<br />
and, when he leaned on the railing of the bridge,<br />
<br />
she<br />
<br />
with<br />
<br />
all<br />
<br />
her<br />
<br />
strength<br />
<br />
inflicted<br />
<br />
a hit<br />
<br />
to<br />
<br />
the head<br />
<br />
from the back,<br />
to the back part of the head,<br />
threw the<br />
stick<br />
in the river<br />
and ran<br />
toward the side of ,<br />
when she ran from FULL_NAME6,<br />
heard the splash of water,<br />
but did not turn around.<br />
<br />
the death of FULL_NAME6 DOB DD.MM.YYYY<br />
was due to splintered-fragmented bone fracture of the<br />
cranial vault and the spreading of cracks on the base of the skull.<br />
<br />
Before his death FULL_NAME6 had consumed alcoholic beverages.<br />
<br />
The fracture of the bones of the skull occurred due to several blows from a blunt hard object<br />
<br />
at least 3 blows,<br />
<br />
with very<br />
<br />
great<br />
<br />
force<br />
<br />
with the narrowed end<br />
of a blunt hard object<br />
of great mass (comparable to the mass of the head)<br />
and hardness, comparable to the hardness of the bones of the cranial vault<br />
