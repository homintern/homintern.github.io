<p>I’m an idiot<br />
I’m a real idiot.<br />
A dang ol’ idiot.<br />
I’m the big dumb idiot.<br />
The big hunk of stupid.<br />
I’m the stupid idiot from the hated idiot warehouse.<br />
From the idiot ditch.<br />
I’m a giant idiot made of embarrassingly writhing idiot pieces.<br />
A mulch of idiocy, wrapped into the shape of a human.<br />
But it can’t hide how stupid I am.<br />
A shape stupidly pummeled into existence.<br />
A pathetic silted heap.<br />
The gurgling dungeon of a billion moronic whims.<br />
Swirling in vicious counsel with one another.<br />
Wailing their songs that describe being a dumbass.<br />
I am a dumbass.<br />
I am the assembled dumbass.<br />
Built out of all the dumbass things I think and do.<br />
I am the dumbass piece of shit who cannot move their brain.<br />
My brain sits in its wobbly home that is the stupid crap head of an imbecile.<br />
A derivative machine belching nonsense.<br />
My brain is a dimpled mess of leaks.<br />
My brain sucks.<br />
It will never not be a maligned crust atop my being.<br />
I will forever be the dim fool it encases.<br />
Listen.<br />
Put your ear to my gurgling throat.<br />
Listen to the addlepated murk it is a funnel for.<br />
I need you to be its audience.<br />
I need you to know how stupid I am.<br />
I need you to believe in my worthless bullshit noises.<br />
Their gargled spate.<br />
The avalanche of croaks I hack up from the bungled cradle of my shitty imagination.<br />
And the total stupidity of my character.<br />
Believe it.<br />
Believe you me.<br />
I’m just a huge, stupid moron.<br />
I’m a giant dumb idiot born from the primordial soup of dumbness.<br />
Sloppy and covered in my own imagined filth.<br />
I have the sloppiest head of brain-mush.<br />
I’m a soppy mush beast of rancid judgement.<br />
I’m the hole terrible ideas get thrown in.<br />
A horrible hole-head of grotesque foolishness.<br />
My mind is a bucket of turgid dregs.<br />
It stews obtusely in my terrible skull.<br />
The air in my head is recycled pablum.<br />
My mind is abreast in refuse.<br />
My mind plugs away at being bad.<br />
A diligent bureaucrat of creating useless gibberish.<br />
It sits around, sopping up ugly brain mud.<br />
My mushy mind of waste.<br />
It feasts on waste.<br />
It wantonly designs more waste.<br />
It pumps that waste out into the world.<br />
It ejects constantly this wasted thought.<br />
My wasteful thoughts of stupidity.<br />
That spew from my mouth like a diarrhetic fountain.<br />
Polluting the world with their tragic clumsiness.<br />
Their staid sucking of goodness from the earth.<br />
They subtract intelligence from the earth’s collective brain power.<br />
The earth is hurt by my living.<br />
By the life that gives my caustic brain access to the world.<br />
The earth is made to suffer.<br />
My brain weasels its way in.<br />
It leaves a trail of havoc.<br />
Its wake is a twisted path of terrorized innocents.<br />
It is made so by the dearth of my cognizance.<br />
My wanting brain, like a weight of dumb terror.<br />
It is a mistake of nature that lets my brain exist.<br />
And nature has paid dearly for that mistake.<br />
All the world’s genius, no matter its deftness, is undone by my brain.<br />
It is a pox upon thought.<br />
My brain is a conspiracy against insight.<br />
I can barely contain its hunger for embarrassment.<br />
It overpowers my better judgement.<br />
A better judgement which is itself suspect.<br />
Because, while somehow determined to be contrary to my general thoughts.<br />
A check against my worst impulses.<br />
It is still, and forever, a part of me.<br />
And therefore stupid.<br />
Which is probably why it does so little.<br />
To protect me from myself.<br />
I stumble into danger constantly.<br />
I stumble into morbid, shameful circumstances.<br />
My accidental catastrophes are a plague upon the living.<br />
Disaster careens out from my uneasy gait.<br />
I am a stumbling bringer of mortification.<br />
I’m the sloppy brain polluter.<br />
I’m the moron from the pits.<br />
My head-pit full of dung.<br />
Awash in the void within my skull.<br />
My skull is where the universe dumps moronic nonsense.<br />
It is a universal toilet for misstatements.<br />
It is where I must marinate in the catastrophe of my horrible imagination.<br />
My imagination is a refuse-strewn corpse of thinking.<br />
It is a rodent’s graveyard of thought.<br />
I’ll just come out and say it.<br />
I’m a fool.<br />
I’m a stupid fool.<br />
I’m a goddamn idiot.<br />
I’m a stupid piece of shit fucking moron.<br />
Goddamn fucking stupid-ass piece of shit.<br />
I’m very serious.<br />
To me, it is not a game.<br />
I’m not joking.<br />
I’m not playing this for laughs.<br />
I’m not out here, making this stuff up.<br />
Hoping to elicit some mirthful response.<br />
Some joyful chuckle, validating my cleverness.<br />
Proving how adept I am at bringing a sunny lightheartedness to our conversation.<br />
How the banalities of our minor banter might become elevated in the cup of my wit.<br />
How I surprise and delight.<br />
How I engage and enrich.<br />
How those who would lend an ear to my speech might find in it some truthful self-reflection.<br />
Borne atop the gusts of my humorous self-ridicule.<br />
My self-skewering observations.<br />
That, like the embrace of an old friend, secure us in a sense of humanity shared.<br />
An understanding that proves us to each other.<br />
Well, not this time, buddy.<br />
What’s really going on is that I’m ridiculously shitty at being smart.<br />
I’m a pile of horse-eaten crud left to dry on the perpetual underside of the lives of geniuses.<br />
The shadow of their actual smart behavior.<br />
Its inverse twin, as far from it as the moon is from the bottom of the sea.<br />
I sit there in the dark and twiddle away my life in the despair of being a thudding shithead.<br />
I’ve got a brain of dry, dead grass.<br />
I’ve got a brain of weak kindling.<br />
My brittle twig brain.<br />
My brain of dusty sediment.<br />
I’ve got a brain full of dead mice.<br />
A little mouse haven of death that is Hell for smart things.<br />
The dumb dead mice exist in the space where my thoughts should be.<br />
They mock me in their lifelessness.<br />
Death props their bodies against my horrible head.<br />
They give me nothing but brain-wasting silence.<br />
Rodent shit exists in the space of my brain where normal people think.<br />
Dense and trembling.<br />
Sometimes I wish I weren’t so dumb.<br />
But there’s nothing to be done.<br />
So mostly I just accept it.<br />
I accept that children call me “the fool with a mind like shit.”<br />
That they think of me as a weak imbecile.<br />
They gnash their teeth and scream at me.<br />
They poke at me with their strong, willful fingers.<br />
They rummage through my bag.<br />
Through my pants.<br />
Their hands jabbing into my pockets<br />
They steal my food.<br />
They steal the rag-like ribbons of cloth I call my clothes.<br />
Tearing them from my spindly frame like dry bark from a twig.<br />
They run laughing into the night.<br />
Flinging the clothes in the air as they go.<br />
Flinging them into puddles.<br />
And there’s nothing i can do.<br />
I’m too stupid to resist.<br />
I can’t challenge them in any way.<br />
They have outfoxed me at every angle.<br />
They see the feral ether of my constant failure.<br />
How I’m just a dumb lunkhead.<br />
How I’m a graven load of imprecision.<br />
A skewered meat lump<br />
How I’m a ponderous sack of pestilent worry.<br />
I stuff my sack head with dirt that makes me stupid.<br />
I consume the exhaust of wrongheaded babble.<br />
I wolf it down like greasy eggs.<br />
I use it to fuel my own rambling snot mentality.<br />
Such is the pitched depravity of my lackluster intellect.<br />
It makes me a target.<br />
It makes me ripe for exploitation and abuse.<br />
My body a rancid meaty receptacle for craven blunders.<br />
It is a pathetic embarrassment.<br />
I am a mocked travesty.<br />
I am a malfunctioning dongle.<br />
I’m a real bump of crud.<br />
A seeping patch.<br />
A rollicking piddle of deranged jargon.<br />
I’m a clod-thinking louse.<br />
I’m a drool-brain.<br />
I’m drooling all over the dinner table.<br />
In the style of an oaf.<br />
A crappy oaf.<br />
Me, ruiner of meals.<br />
I am the ruiner of tables.<br />
I drape my mess of a mouth on their slick surface.<br />
I let the ravaged excess inside me dribble out of the holes in my skull.<br />
My big mouth hole.<br />
My corrosive maw.<br />
My imagination is like a pustule.<br />
Oozing from my fetid tongue.<br />
My botched mouth.<br />
The deficient orifice reeking loss.<br />
Like the bankrupt yawn my intelligence is constantly awash in.<br />
Washing in that sleepy dirge.<br />
Salivating at the idea of letting rip another dumbfuck comment.<br />
Drool defines my way of life, my being.<br />
A slovenly bundle.<br />
I have no more sense.<br />
I blew it all on trying to think of more stupid bullshit to eke out.<br />
From the fallow wastes where my minuscule brain cells try to grow cool thinks to talk about.<br />
They fail of course.<br />
They are all lost to their failure.<br />
Awash in the agony of disuse.<br />
Withering into sodden decomposing husks.<br />
Crushed by the overwhelming, inevitable fact of how fucking stupid I am.<br />
How stupid we are together.<br />
Together we know that we are both dumb as an iguana’s freshly left shit.<br />
I stare into my own brain and see only these piles of fresh shit.<br />
Now my wits are shot.<br />
They’re like break pads worn down to a nub.<br />
They are incapable of decelerating the full-throttle tumbling on of crap my mind invents.<br />
It is as if my mind is my enemy.<br />
I can’t trust it.<br />
It betrays me at every moment.<br />
It’s like a malfunctioning blender.<br />
A jagged mockery of purposeful use.<br />
The only use it has for me is to make my life worse.<br />
Because of all the ridiculous babble it hoists on me.<br />
All of the vicious games it plays with my trust.<br />
I open my mouth imagining it will send some delightful quip through my throat.<br />
Some anointed observation, elegant and true.<br />
And instead it embarrasses me.<br />
It croaks out a cracked yelp.<br />
A dud.<br />
A palpably wrong assessment of the most obvious sort.<br />
It echoes amongst the civitates..<br />
It rampages through the halls of the proudly smart.<br />
And the usually thoughtful.<br />
And even the middlingly thoughtful.<br />
It exists as a warning to all.<br />
The people fear it.<br />
And if they don’t yet, they soon will.<br />
That screech of my failure.<br />
The waking nightmare that my constant dithering has become.<br />
My uselessness.<br />
My total ignorance of how to think.<br />
They don’t “fear it” in the sense they would a despot.<br />
Or legendary beast or impending natural disaster.<br />
They “fear it” like they fear a mistimed bowel movement.<br />
Or an unnoticed massive rip in the crotch of one’s jeans.<br />
Such is my stature in the thinking community.<br />
It is a mortifying lapse.<br />
My dumb vacant face.<br />
My plunking cluttered voice.<br />
My grasping thoughts.<br />
My gnarled speech.<br />
It is a weed, or an invasive insect.<br />
It is a blight.<br />
A sinkhole of tar.<br />
A stain upon the world of competency.<br />
It is like a bag of packed organs left out in the sun.<br />
I am an awful stuffed bag of festering organ product.<br />
I am as smart as the inflated dead bladder of a cretin.<br />
I am as smart as a dead bag of piss.<br />
Oh, yes.<br />
I am certainly a dunderhead.<br />
I am certainly a wrecked gob.<br />
I am most certainly that.<br />
I’m the bearer of the terrible brain.<br />
This is my burden.<br />
To obey the repugnant theses of my torrid pudding head.<br />
I have to think like a jug, for all eternity.<br />
The moronic glug of my thoughts.<br />
Here is an example.<br />
Let me tell you a story.<br />
Here’s something that happened to me because I was so stupid.<br />
This one time, in a fit of stupidity, I went to stick a hand in my brain.<br />
And all I found was a thick sludge of babbling trash.<br />
