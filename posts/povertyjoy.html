<p>to regard what I’ve given you</p>
<p>or rather</p>
<p>what we’ve given each other</p>
<p>as little more than a companion that brings a kind of joy</p>
<p>in the same quiet way a cat or dog</p>
<p>asleep at the foot of your bed</p>
<p>might accompany you</p>
<p>as you start to drift off</p>
<p>only vaguely aware of these images which emerge in the drowsy half-attention of your conscious mind</p>
<p>and acknowledging each one before you send them on their way</p>
<p>letting them spread out before you</p>
<p>like stars</p>
<p>growing in number</p>
<p>as they group themselves</p>
<p>loosely</p>
<p>into constellations</p>
<p>the names of which escape you as you begin to connect them with faint incandescent lines</p>
<p>joining them together in shapes that resemble</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>a skeleton</p>
<p>poorly sketched across the black expanse of your mind and not unlike your own</p>
<p>onto which you can briefly project your attention</p>
<p>and as you drift</p>
<p>towards this projection of your corporal body</p>
<p>the latter becoming more abstract as you approach</p>
<p>so that this mental calm</p>
<p>couples with a numbness</p>
<p>beginning in your solar plexus and radiating out to the extremity of each limb</p>
<p>until this muted vibration is pulsating throughout your body</p>
<p>such that the pain that accompanies you in your daily life</p>
<p>the suffering that forms the way in which you recognize that the visual plane you experience is your own</p>
<p>becomes only a distant sensation</p>
<p>that seems to continue to move further away</p>
<p>and as you watch it recede you realize that your own body is not unlike</p>
<p>say</p>
<p>the stars as the sharpness of their edges against the blackness of the sky disappears</p>
<p>the boundaries of the world in which you find yourself embedded</p>
<p>grow less and less distinct</p>
<p>so too does your own body</p>
<p>as if your muscles and tendons</p>
<p>your very flesh</p>
<p>had begun to dissolve</p>
<p>leaving little trace</p>
<p>nothing more than a faint outline</p>
<p>and in this way</p>
<p>we come to understand that anything I have to say to you</p>
<p>now</p>
<p>or what we’ve already said to each other</p>
<p>is of little importance</p>
<p>other than creating something for us to take with us in the quiet of our collective death</p>
<p>so that in this moment of calm we can experience</p>
<p>sitting here</p>
<p>in each other’s company</p>
<p>something</p>
<p>not unlike that moment before</p>
<p>the moment before the last</p>
<p>in which someone who perhaps resembles us</p>
<p>but is not us</p>
<p>will share</p>
<p>before they watch themselves</p>
<p>slip off together</p>
<p>towards extinction</p>
