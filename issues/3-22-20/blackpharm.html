</p>
<p class="nowrap">who entered into the map of their moods<br />
your childhood disgust,<br />
the slippery palms of a river bed?<br />
<br />
the medium trembles when we<br />
appear in it<br />
<br />
hello, I’m a beast,<br />
a soundless beast<br />
upon catching sight of me<br />
empty nets of nature<br />
flow downstream<br />
<br />
on this earth<br />
it’s no one’s business,<br />
what we’ve said to each other.<br />
<br />
invent me a car—<em>“black pharmacopeia”</em><br />
in the depths of sleep, in the adult pharma gloom,<br />
where there’s sleepwalker-sounds, bodies-rattlings.<br />
the car burns in the desert.<br />
but you don’t have a lens. you don’t see.<br />
<br />
invent me a body, taut, like the string of a bow,<br />
instead of un-walkable mountains of fat,<br />
and loose lumps of feelings,<br />
imagine me a body,<br />
abashed, like the glance of an aperture<br />
<br />
hello, beast-ne’er-do-well, beast-pain,<br />
melancholy’s beast, beast-psychosis,<br />
dearest, you carry the end of time<br />
on tail’s tip, your eyes<br />
burn red<br />
in the darkness of the adult pharma,<br />
your palms, slippery as the auditoriums of a river bed, carry<br />
the kernels of transformation<br />

<h2>Fragments and voices from the green notebook of G.R. and Georgiy</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Today the body consists of self-organizing “assemblages” and virtual surfaces (the specificifics of which depend on the nature of its connection to its milieu). There is an erosion occurring between a body and environment, yours and a stranger’s, one body and many.</p>
<p>Due to this, the body is no longer represented in science and medicine by organs, skeleton, or fluids, but by complex “assemblages” such as: hormones, the immune system, neurotransmitters, microflora etc. What does it mean then to be in your own body? To be a body? To be in a body, in which it feels good to be?<br />
</p>
<p><em>the old world with its crumbling brown seats of Soviet buses, with its silhouette of a horse against an autumn field – found in a computer graphic; my body is in it, and the transfigured gaze of the melancholic embracing the damp ground of an empty lot, his chest – in “reality”, and <strong>his men</strong> against a cratered wall, knives in hand.</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Queer-writing does not aim to obtain identity and subjectivity within language, within literature, or of expressing the specific experience of “non-normative” corporeality; instead it emphasizes the processual aspect of a given corporeality, the fluidity of identity, the complexity of interacting bodies, languages, affects and environments. Subjectivity becomes spectral, slippery, plasma. Queer-processes of reasoning, cognition, action and writing are oriented towards what speculative materialism refers to as a “twisted access to reality.” At the same time, we cannot reduce everything only to dynamics of the surface, of emergence; we must define a queer-materiality. Grab hold of this strangeness. Animals, cars, viruses, boxes, webs and nets, dis-embodied, strange, deadly and vital, imagining and imagined by each other, sniffing and licking, intaking and expelling, muddying the waters and writing nonsense.</p>

<h3><strong><em>Georgiy’s dream (Georgiy’s birth out of himself):</em></strong></h3>
<p>Last night closer to morning I had a dream it’s as if I’m running away from someone between gray metallic garages the passageways between them narrow and whimsically morphing from one into another I have to squeeze between them I have no fear but there is a feeling of strange peril to be moving in a different way all of a sudden it becomes clear that the garages and the squeezing between them are cunts vaginas that is to say I am running squeezing through old hard gray metallic vaginas shifting from one into another and there’s no way I can be born as georgiy<br />
out of myself.</p>
<p>The already solidifying puddle of blood in front of the store, as if it burst there, self-saturating – suddenly, red on solid, two bent staircases cut across the street in a strange way, hand-made from some kind of logs, a no-entry sign with a red and white ribbon, overturned and apparently no longer fulfilling any of its longstanding prohibitive functions, a pancake of ice between the even streams of the sidewalk, two flower shop women at their lonely kiosk repeat after each other: “flowers and flowers – are flowers, flowers – are flowers” a momentary celebration of an encapsulated, pure tautology; inscribed on the other side – in a different tangent of this tautology: is the parallelepiped of the <em>Übermensch’s</em> grave, summoned by the day from the scattering habitats of letters, four marked objects – just so, something was returning home late last night along several streaming streets, and a sudden clarity dawns, one where you realize that you are moving through this precinct, hearing your own footsteps alone and clear, as if catching up with themselves and merging incompatible temporalities into a Petersburg moment, in which the matter of stone moves faster than the sky.</p>
<p class="nowrap"><br />
<em>there is something that you cannot see:</em><br />
<em>in us</em><br />
<em>blindness is allocated differently from sight,</em><br />
<em>forming a bundle of things on the bank of a dried up stream,</em><br />
<em>over the dead Aral and wood rot;</em><br />
<em>new life, new form – lacking the signs</em><br />
<em>they tear apart the road with their movement and drive desire</em><br />
<em>into a movement without a majority</em><br />

<h2><strong><em>Kiev’s Answer:</em></strong></h2>
<p class="nowrap"><br />
“Rymbu G.V. Sector 64640 city Dniprodzerzhynsk<br />
dismissed to the reserve as of November 24, 1986<br />
within the verified orders of the commander, outposting to the Chernobyl liquidation zone not listed”<br />
<br />
<em>- why are you so uptight when I stroke you,</em><br />
<em>despite the fact that you are on these pills,</em><br />
<em>why are you silent, as if holding your tongue in your teeth?</em><br />
<br />
- because father sits inside me and moves his elbows from within,<br />
he sees you, sees what is happening, but from <em>the other side</em><br />
of my belly, he is so small! and day after day hoists<br />
small bags of flour, every month he fills out small salary forms,<br />
but he doesn’t go home after work<br />
doesn’t talk,<br />
this is the problem - he just carries them senselessly back and forth …<br />
<br />
he writes: <strong><em>i was in this zone</em></strong> <em>I did something there,</em><br />
<em>which you, leftists, don’t do, in your ranks,</em><br />
<em>you don’t sing for us like the lăutari<sup>1</sup> sing,</em><br />
<em>crooked legs stamping their joy into the ground</em><br />
<br />
“Soon the bags will become altogether large,” dad thinks, sitting down on the abandoned railway,<br />
he lights a smoke and takes out a bag of sweets from his pocket …<br />
<br />
…………………………………………………………<br />
<br />
At night when I can’t sleep<br />
I think roughly, as before: paradise is a mountain of free produce<br />
and years of merry flatulence over disbanded committees,<br />
production turned head over tail,<br />
comfortable clothes without hype, normal weather, beer, wine,<br />
and new bodily configurations, already without cunts, without dicks,<br />
walking on their own on the planets of other galaxies;<br />
<br />
these are sectors of doubt and uncertainty, sprouting into new social movements;<br />
this is a fire without petrol; this is when skins, severed from the animals, return,<br />
transport them back to the world of the living…<br />
<br />
these are queer angels in empty city sewers,<br />
playing on iron partitions.<br />
<br />
this is a time without messages…<br />

<h2><em>boy</em></h2>
<p class="nowrap"><br />
what are you fucked by when you stare<br />
in my direction as if in the direction of death<br />
when your back caves in<br />
like the back of a boy<br />
<br />
the boy past my shoulder trembles besides me<br />
while I sleep<br />
<br />
saying<br />
they are all in your stomach<br />
<br />
your tired eyelid<br />
opens halfway in my<br />
direction<br />
and compresses the brown road into vision crushing it<br />
beats fire into your thin legs<br />
and rustles a gray german camera<br />
inside my pupil how<br />
will he awaken<br />
when the movement from your back leads<br />
towards death<br />
<br />
having taken that which no longer even lifts our eyelids<br />
we would keep it within bodies that are washed before burning<br />
when we went so crazy that the lymph couldn’t free itself from the crowd<br />
closeness clinging like dirt<br />
<br />
here’s a red movement<br />
while you sleep<br />
while I sleep<br />
it occurs<br />
<br />
staring at you<br />
I want you the way an animal drowns<br />
as my shroud sleeps between my legs<br />
I ’d curl up at the feet with you<br />
like an animal<br />
<br />
the skin around your eyes is tired of time<br />
impotence has dried out your lips<br />
due to this world’s power<br />
you don’t have a body<br />
<br />
these roots you don’t have, I’d tear out<br />
and plant within my slow memory<br />
in this manner we’d fuck<br />
I’d fuck right through you<br />
I’d open your ass<br />
<br />
these words are hidden<br />
<br />
when you sleep I look at how the skin around your eyes<br />
is tired how your breath moves towards time<br />
how your back bends towards<br />
death<br />
<br />
you wake up and you say we need to laugh more<br />
and I think how the lautari trample the earth into the earth<br />
with wide feet         to fuck death<br />
I want your tongue like a shovel<br />
to mindlessly dig in my desert and fall<br />
sluggish<br />
into sick water<br />
<br />
in this country<br />
in this spot where we live<br />
there’s not enough salty<br />
squirt water<br />
<br />
