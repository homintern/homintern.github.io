<p> </p>
<p>Those mornings, I would wake up too late.<br />
No sun, no cell phone<br />
Ever roused me. <em>Melancholia</em><br />
The high and ancient illness,<br />
In Morpheus’ clutch constrained me.<br />
I dreamt that there was no Being.<br />
<br />
The dumbest dream! And what a joy,<br />
That Parmenides wrote poetry. Being<br />
Cannot “be” or “not be,” it is not an object<br />
But a concept, а prison for meaning, and reality<br />
Is always fickle, and that which was a “cat”<br />
In one iteration, will not remain a “cat”<br />
After one more stir of the paws.<br />
<br />
And that is why speech will remain unbearable,<br />
Until it gains the right<br />
To performatively lay down the law.<br />
<br />
I thought of you, and I woke up.<br />
On the table were flowers in a vase.<br />
A voice came to me: in another life,<br />
Go to bed at eight, wake up at eight<br />
Like all poets, study antiquity.<br />
And study generative grammar<br />
And no pragmatic linguistics!<br />
<br />
…With what kind of text can I express<br />
how measurements flare up through one another?<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
[further—<br />
—a fragment, written in a different style.<br />
This poem would be <em>better</em> without it]<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
<em>they</em> say<br />
“yes, he’s sexist, but an excellent analyst”<br />
<br />
<em>they</em> say<br />
“any means are good means at war with the police state”<br />
<br />
<em>they</em> say<br />
“we’re LGBT-friendly”<br />
<br />
<em>they</em> say<br />
“remember Pasolini’s poetry?”<br />
<br />
<em>they</em><br />
call themselves “heterosexuals”<br />
<br />
<em>they</em><br />
are just afraid to love<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
You look like Alexander Skidan<br />
says she<br />
<br />
Polina Aronson speaks<br />
About love, which looks like a dream<br />
<br />
A push, falling to the bottom<br />
Luna sings<br />
<br />
put your finger in my mouth<br />
(and the other way around)<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
Eros does not sleep. Eros reads the Jena<br />
Romantics, because he knows well:<br />
the Psyche lives in non-causal<br />
prosaic repetitions (By the way,<br />
how is this positioned<br />
topologically?)<br />
<br />
Wounds appear on semantemes,<br />
and potentially in language too,<br />
<br />
<em>(and</em><br />
<em>therefore we know about this)</em><br />
<br />
That Lyuba Sobol will kill<br />
Our tyrant—and she will eat his heart.<br />
<br />
We sleep. But even in our dreams, as Montlevich says,<br />
We react to exterior light<br />
And will move bodies and objects<br />
Through a liberative, clarifying stream.<br />
Sleep, little cat. Let the war leave.<br />
<br />
<br />
