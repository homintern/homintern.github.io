<h2>Miniput</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>“No uproar<br />
balances the tare,<br />
and so makes of it<br />
a little doodle<br />
easier to<br />
collect than most,<br />
like silkworms,<br />
punctuational<br />
whispers<br />
and gunpowder*,<br />
and gunpowder**<br />
made out of boredom,<br />
and retribution,<br />
in that order.”<br />
<br />
*Regarding the fire.<br />
The fire-mordant ewers.<br />
The fire, as in<br />
the mordance<br />
of the ewer,<br />
I guess a thing<br />
to put fire in,<br />
containing in dramatic fashion.<br />
The fire-mordant ewers contain<br />
in a dramatic fashion<br />
the seal<br />
between base and basis.<br />
Tension imbued with<br />
a very, very<br />
particular sense –<br />
what a coincidence,<br />
the kind of sense the people<br />
on your side enjoy<br />
– analogous to the surface<br />
of water, oil, milk, and so on.<br />
Which makes the fire liquid<br />
and then not much can be done.<br />
Or the fire-mordant<br />
ewers contain<br />
in a dramatic fashion<br />
the tension, no, sorry<br />
the seal<br />
between one base and another.<br />
It has to be unbroken. Not<br />
at all messed with.<br />
And not base –<br />
not base<br />
in the very loose sense<br />
enjoyed by the people<br />
on my side, whom<br />
I somehow enjoy.<br />
Oh, I<br />
forgot: mordant.<br />
Mordant is great. Mordant is like<br />
a grin, a grin partaking in<br />
what is happening to you.<br />
This is what contains what seals<br />
the fire<br />
from basis to basis,<br />
and the seal is the fuel,<br />
making this only workable<br />
in this place, in this moment.<br />
Something beside itself.<br />
It won’t fit, but isn’t lost.<br />
So let’s leave it<br />
out. The fire<br />
that the fire-mordant ewer<br />
contains in its drama is<br />
the seal that pours out,<br />
decanting this basis.<br />
Wait. No,<br />
there needed<br />
to be more<br />
than one.<br />
Oh,<br />
wait, there was.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>I Feel Auckland</h2>
<p><br />
Will you return<br />
<br />
like the hover-sever<br />
tends to return,<br />
or come again,<br />
<br />
in time?<br />
<br />
Will your favourite trait be<br />
an extant gratitude in the blocks,<br />
<br />
or an extant gratitude<br />
in the extinct blocks?<br />
<br />
To do that,<br />
to return,<br />
<br />
you may need once more<br />
to take up<br />
that specific form of wariness<br />
that was<br />
as common as it was<br />
fashionable in<br />
your youth;<br />
peutellic wariness, wasn’t it?<br />
<br />
But you were right,<br />
in leaving here.<br />
I can put everything aside<br />
and admit this.<br />
<br />
If you need to<br />
do<br />
something like that<br />
to return,<br />
that taking up –<br />
if you<br />
out of all<br />
of us,<br />
if you have to<br />
do this<br />
thing among all<br />
possible things –<br />
you shouldn’t come back.<br />
You shouldn’t return.<br />
You shouldn’t come again.<br />
And no,<br />
no one<br />
should ever,<br />
ever have<br />
asked it of you.<br />
One day, I promise,<br />
I will find out who did.<br />
<br />
