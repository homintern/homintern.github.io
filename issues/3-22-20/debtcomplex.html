<h2>DEBT COMPLEX</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>m: unnatural witch<br />
i summoned you and what<br />
<br />
            w:<br />
<br />
m: you are I, my hunger<br />
pure dream, you exist &amp; with mystique<br />
and pen, you always already are – mine<br />
<br />
            w: do you care more about sodomy as noun<br />
            or verb?<br />
<br />
m: name what you want<br />
if i have to i will plagiarize<br />
to make u citizen<br />
i will<br />
<br />
            w: <em>writhes, ecstatically</em><br />
<br />
m: we hear nothing<br />
petty hysteria<br />
what do you make of my suffering?<br />
<br />
            w: <em>laughs, silently</em><br />
<br />
m: i’m willing to make a contract<br />
i will rip open the honey for you<br />
your mask is my stain, you are my pores<br />
let’s make a deal<br />
baby<br />
<br />
            w: why do we never use the whip i bought you for your birthday<br />
            there it sits, rusting on the nail above the bed.<br />
            you are always too tired, fuck you.<br />
<br />
m: i thought we decided to only use it in public<br />
from now on<br />
your idea.<br />
take this knife.<br />
<br />
            w: <em>slicing onions, beginning to cry</em><br />
<br />
m: silent, as always<br />
aren’t we fighting<br />
for the same thing?<br />
<br />
            w: i fight, i hallucinate.<br />
            the more i read, i haven’t read.<br />
            this tragedy won’t write itself<br />
            you gaslight your own narrative<br />
            it’s maddening. i don’t care<br />
            how we are read,<br />
            only how we are reading<br />
<br />
m: you are not perceptible<br />
there are rooms you can’t enter<br />
your voice rings at pitches, many ears don’t hear<br />
<br />
w: do you have anything to say? you keep changing teams.<br />
<br />
m: you can’t perform an object into object<br />
we are matter<br />
<br />
            w: if all people are citizens,<br />
            is anyone really citizen?<br />
you need me,<br />
            you see<br />
            to see yourself<br />
<br />
m: i think sodomy only exists as verb<br />
i want to be a billionaire<br />
i need expensive teapots, i need to skip the meetings<br />
i need my reflection to move across shop windows<br />
pure commodity<br />
<br />
            w: i am scared, something about my soul<br />
<br />
<em>a glass falls from the table and shatters</em><br />
<br />
m: it culminates in us all<br />
but in none of us particularly<br />
that is what pains me<br />
that pain is what i cannot see<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>BAD SUB</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>m: i fear my questions reduce you.<br />
i’d like to extend an invitation to you<br />
to my fantasy<br />
<br />
            w: despite the snow i come<br />
            forbidden<br />
            archaic, to rsvp<br />
<br />
m: there is too much information<br />
to celebrate anything<br />
<br />
            w: there is love between us<br />
            infinite<br />
            there is after all<br />
<br />
m: do you think<br />
my poetry is too hostile?<br />
<br />
            w: O honey of my masculinity<br />
            i’ll never say no.<br />
            No,<br />
i am blind<br />
            with submission<br />
            i sit at your knees<br />
            your fantasy of our relation determines us<br />
<br />
m: despite the snow you came<br />
despite the genre<br />
now tell me – what is your real name?<br />
<br />
            w: you are seeming out of touch<br />
            consent is a literal myth<br />
            yes can also mean no<br />
<br />
m: i beg you to so you will<br />
<br />
            w: draw me a bath and make me dinner<br />
            i’m ready to believe, you think you hear me say<br />
            i’m ready to believe<br />
            to be liberated<br />
            each morning i wake up and pray<br />
            organize me<br />
            who will organize me today<br />
<br />
m: you mock me<br />
i like the word halt<br />
because it is immediate<br />
and definitive<br />
but it feels impermanent<br />
stop<br />
on the other hand<br />
may take a while<br />
but lasts<br />
<br />
            w: pls do both<br />
            this is bad phenomenology<br />
            or is it<br />
            you are rhetorically<br />
            ineffective?<br />
<br />
m: you are too bratty of a bottom<br />
you are lucky to be in my story<br />
are you asking to get slapped?<br />
<br />
            w: the hardest part<br />
            for us both<br />
            is that you need my refusal<br />
            as much as you need me to appear<br />
<br />
m: our dialectic it<br />
brings me pain<br />
<br />
            w: you fall asleep first<br />
            oblique, spread too thin<br />
            the pain isn’t serving you<br />
<br />
m: unrepresentable pain<br />
i cave in the doorway<br />
moss grows over my eyelids<br />
i grow later and later<br />
it has occurred to me<br />
in such a way i cannot commit<br />
<br />
            w: like dirt, I think<br />
            you need reimagining<br />
<br />
