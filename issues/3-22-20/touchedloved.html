i understood what the matter was<br />
everything rounds up<br />
yes-no<br />
<br />
how terrifying it was at the last free market<br />
when i caught my shirt on a nail<br />
and the shirt tore under the right shoulder blade<br />
a new paisley shirt<br />
i’ve been wearing it several days in a row already<br />
washing it at night in the sink and putting it on in the morning<br />
even if it’s still damp<br />
i touched myself through the hole on the back with my finger<br />
and say to those i know i tore my shirt<br />
they smile nod in the direction of ten thousand free things<br />
in the direction of thousands of people who bring in and take away all of these things<br />
— here, take another one<br />
<br />
at home i took off the shirt and didn’t find the hole<br />
where it was<br />
looked at it against the light<br />
nothing<br />
<br />
between desire and embodiment<br />
so little time passes<br />
and along the way we die<br />
who will cross out the unnecessary words here when i die<br />
<br />
the new grandmothers don’t know how to darn<br />
annoyance or catastrophe<br />
leads to<br />
you accidentally touching yourself<br />
naked<br />
in a public space<br />
and everything rounds up<br />
<br />
what disquiet<br />
and the kids? where are they<br />
they are playing in the disquiet<br />

maria at therapy<br />
speaks of maria<br />
the screams of maria<br />
weed and yoga don’t take away the pain of maria<br />
the painkillers designed for painkilling maria<br />
all on its own<br />
a world of maria<br />

any defined<br />
forgotten word<br />
the lost free time of maria<br />

after everything that happened<br />
in all this time<br />
to collide without much thought<br />
say something different<br />
subvert<br />

maria articulates maria<br />

and here’s the first love<br />
just got married<br />
a photo in a wedding dress<br />
and a new last name<br />

she doesn’t love him her new last name with a e<br />

optional dots<br />
but we sat through a year together<br />
in russian and in literature<br />
<br />
tanya wrote about something else<br />
that this is normal<br />
this is our genetic trait from the monkeys<br />
to see dots in the hair and on the body<br />
of ourselves and our partner<br />
<br />
about searching for insects<br />

(i am still afraid of those magnifying mirrors<br />
in the bathrooms of hotels)<br />

control over history<br />
like over words around an axis<br />
holding my breath<br />
while the cortisol secretes<br />

only if asked<br />
but nobody asks<br />

the speed of an unseen person<br />
grabbing me by the elbow<br />
so as not to collapse<br />

equilibrium<br />

the weight of presence<br />

tactile deprivation interrupted<br />
