<h2>CAUTIONARY NOTICE</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Information will be transmitted now</p>
<p>You see the letters through which information will be transmitted</p>
<p>They form the words for the transmission of that information</p>
<p>And those in turn form syntagmas and larger units</p>
<p>And much much larger</p>
<p>In this way unnoticeable to ourselves</p>
<p>We turn out to be absorbed in the process of reception-transmission</p>
<p>That judging by everything has been going on for a long time</p>
<p>And which does not particularly rely on us</p>
<p>During the time of travel we will see only a small particle</p>
<p>A drop extracted from the stream as if by pure chance</p>
<p>But in it will be reflected the remainder</p>
<p>Like it or not nothing else will be offered</p>
<p>The grains of sand move at high velocity leaving in their wake</p>
<p>A concise record of a vast cosmic voyage</p>
<p>Constricted on both sides</p>
<p>By the blinding photosphere and the icy darkness of night</p>
<p>Thereby producing</p>
<p>An universal history of voyages</p>
<p>It is unknown when this began</p>
<p>It is unknown when it will end</p>
<p>The information stream is vast</p>
<p>And life as usual is short</p>
<p>And in the struggle between the two</p>
<p>The information stream prevails</p>
<p>Over this so-called life</p>
<p>That the scientists assert is</p>
<p>Akin to a drop of water</p>
<p>Catching one’s attention as it plummets through a beam of light</p>
<p>Similar to an accidental line</p>
<p>From a book snatched at random</p>
<p>From the shelf of a limitless library</p>
<p>The catalogue of which is bottomless</p>
<p>(In this line are usually input dual calendar dates</p>
<p>Written in unintelligible symbols</p>
<p>In accordance with unknown rules</p>
<p>In a language known to no one)</p>
<p>Turn your attention to how easily information is transmitted</p>
<p>To the speed at which the stream passes through us</p>
<p>How the innumerable mistakes of transmission spark in the darkness</p>
<p>It is not worth it to try to divide the useful from the useless</p>
<p>To prefer the good news to the miscellaneous</p>
<p>To employ corrective filters</p>
<p>It is recommended to let in as a whole</p>
<p>Life pierced every second</p>
<p>By the solar wind dancing on shuttered lids</p>
<p>It is what stirs in the sails</p>
<p>It is what scatters ships</p>
<p>It is what makes us transparent and light</p>
<p>Like it does that very same drop</p>
<p>The grain of rice</p>
<p>The particle of quartz</p>
<p>The accidental line</p>
<p>(Dual dates)</p>

<h2>***</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is conducted an analysis of a poetic text</p>
<p>Which emerges simultaneously with this very same analysis</p>
<p>So that it seems impossible to separate them</p>
<p>In terms of form or content</p>
<p>The word “analysis” has appeared in the poem twice already</p>
<p>Which can’t possibly not raise alarm</p>
<p>Look it’s already three times</p>
<p>Such statistics give one the idea</p>
<p>That we will not find any kind of analysis here</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the term itself has come up for the fourth time already</p>
<p>From the scientific perspective the text does not present any interest</p>
<p>Just like from the perspective of art</p>
<p>Just like from the perspective of jurisprudence</p>
<p>Just like from the perspective of national security</p>
<p>Just like from the perspective of sac fungi (ascomycota)</p>
<p>Just like from all other perspectives</p>
<p>Due to its rootedness in everyday language</p>
<p>Its protocol-like dryness</p>
<p>Its lack of conceptual rigor, phonetic resonances</p>
<p>And other expressive idiosyncrasies</p>
<p>The present text risks becoming one of the less memorable</p>
<p>Within an array of poems composed at approximately the same time in the Russian language</p>
<p>Succeeding each other via this or that degree</p>
<p>of conceptual alignment with self-referentiality</p>
<p>It’s possible that we are dealing with the latest attempt to draw attention</p>
<p>To the problem of representation</p>
<p>To the question of signs</p>
<p>Not referring to anything but themselves</p>
<p>That’s not too curious of an idiosyncrasy</p>
<p>Rather it’s a kind a commonplace spot</p>
<p>And it hardly makes sense to stop on it</p>
<p>Furthermore</p>
<p>To the strengths of this text can be attributed its</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Transparency</p></li>
<li><p>Suchness</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwiseness</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And relative conciseness</p>
<p><br />
