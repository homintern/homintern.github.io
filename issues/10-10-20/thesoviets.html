<br />
From inside iron and the wholesome<br />
insides of the trees<br />
they were born.<br />
With them the true notion of dawn came to the world,<br />
and words of love, wise and ancient,<br />
sprang up like the wheatstalks of svelte poetry.<br />
From mine and river, they came<br />
from book and thought, they came.<br />
Lenin gave them sense and strategy.<br />
Songs of untamed nature arrived too,<br />
and, I repeat, it was the dawn.<br />
The cities were born, the lakes and the valleys,<br />
the seas, canals, the pipelines<br />
filled with longing premonition;<br />
in their eyes those men carried a light of mastery.<br />
And they mastered.<br />
So with the whole dawn,<br />
with the lathe, the tractor, and the pin<br />
work had a fresh sense of triumph.<br />
And they triumphed.<br />
From the Baltic to the Pacific, a rumor,<br />
a flame, a virtue was born:<br />
and there were statues and armies.<br />
And there was a man, too<br />
(no man in the world works more than he)<br />
a man of burning metal,<br />
a man of superhuman quality<br />
a Soviet: Stalin.<br />
Heir, like the electric regions,<br />
like the coal mines and the oil mantles,<br />
to Lenin’s prophetic vision.<br />
What profile is his, that so seduces<br />
the men, his men, and us,<br />
the plants of the high plateaus?<br />
And what is his word like, his Soviet word?<br />
We do not hear him, we do not see him, we do not touch him<br />
with excited hands and respect and tenderness:<br />
his eyes in which intelligence flowers<br />
do not look upon us, smiling<br />
and we cannot touch, kiss<br />
his prodigious grey hairs of a universal father.<br />
But he is here, like Lenin, present.<br />
Is not his style felt,<br />
is it not perceived there, my comrade?<br />
His breath and slogan?<br />
His name, his brilliant peals<br />
are inside the heart<br />
and in the air<br />
in the eagle’s wings<br />
and in the earth<br />
in the youthful laurels<br />
and in the water,<br />
in the manly bang of the oarsmen.<br />
Everywhere, yes,<br />
with waves and proclamation,<br />
with the shooting in Europe<br />
and the bridge blown up by the anti-Nazi saboteurs,<br />
with the Ukrainian guerillas and the communist youth of France;<br />
with the serene simplicity of the Chinese soldiers and the death of the Mexicans in the Philippines;<br />
with the English commando and the young American;<br />
with us, here, in this air,<br />
in this house and in that garden.<br />
Wherever the eyes glance<br />
a Soviet soldier will be keeping watch,<br />
wherever the gaze falls,<br />
our golden Stalin will guard the landscape.<br />
Sweeter still than the terrible spilled blood<br />
is the perfect face of the world’s future.<br />
Cheers for the Soviets and their great leader Stalin!<br />
